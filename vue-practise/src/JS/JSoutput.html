<!-- JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:

Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
Changing the innerHTML property of an HTML element is a common way to display data in HTML.

Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
For testing purposes, it is convenient to use document.write()

Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
You can skip the window keyword.
In JavaScript, the window object is the global scope object. This means that variables, properties, and methods by default belong to the window object. This also means that specifying the window keyword is optional.


Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
For debugging purposes, you can call the console.log() method in the browser to display data.
